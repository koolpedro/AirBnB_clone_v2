Requirements

Python Scripts
1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
3. All your files should end with a new line
4. The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
5. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
6. Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
7. All your files must be executable
8. The length of your files will be tested using wc
9. All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
10. All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
11. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
12. A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

Python Unit Tests

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files should end with a new line
3. All your test files should be inside a folder tests
4. You have to use the unittest module
5. All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
6. All your test files and folders should start by test_
7. Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
8. All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
9. You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
10. All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
11. All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
12. All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
13. We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases

SQL Scripts

1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
2. All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using MySQL 8.0
3. Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.4.x
4. All your files should end with a new line
5. All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
6. All your files should start by a comment describing the task
7. All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
8. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
9. The length of your files will be tested using wc
